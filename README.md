# LearningRust

A self managed repo to track my progress learning Rust.

### Objectives

My primary objectives of this repo are to:

    - Broadly learn Rust's syntax
    - Develop my understanding of lower-leveled programming
    - Learn how to manipulate and handle memory
    - Adjust to using commits and branches in projects

### Notes

Some quick notes:

    - My commit names have been absolutely horrible so please ignore them and any of their inconsistencies.
    - If you have any tips or find any glaring issues with my structure, understanding, or efficieny of Rust, please let me know.
